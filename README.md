# Logging investigations

## How can we prioritize our errors?
Some errors are low priority and can be safely ignored - to fix later
Some errors are extremely important and need to be investigated and followed up ASAP to check impact.
Some errors are in-between low and extremely important

## How can we categorize types of errors?
It's not obvious about the context of each error, is this a input validation error, runtime error or an API error or something else?
